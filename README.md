The GameLogic file is the main program that calls the other sections of code:
SpawnPepperTestPointing: which starts the virtual simulation and enables pepper to move

you will need to use pip install to install any imported modules you may need such as numpy or the q


Should you still recieve any errors after installing said moules it may be because you are running the wrong verison of python, try switching to python 3.6.8 and you should be fine

needed modules:
qibullet
cv2
